Controllers
===

**Controllers** - business logic of your project. Controller contains multiple **actions** - methods of the controller.

Project contains one or multiple controllers. All controllers located in `controllers` folder.

When you call a page `/blogs` the `controllers.blogs.Blogs` involved to handle this request. In this case - the `index` action will be called. When you call a page `/blogs/create` the same `Blogs` controller used, but with his `create` method.

Main project controller called `Index`. When you request website - you see welcome page that generated by `Index` controller and his `index` action. If you request page that doesn't exists - the `not_found` action calls, starting from requested controller and ending search the `not_found` action in the `Index` controller.


Naming
---

Controller is a class that defined in the file with the same name as the controller, but in lower case. For example, the `Blogs` controller should be defined in `controllers/blogs.py` file.

Controller has actions - functions that defined inside the class. For example, when you show an article change form or POST this form - you need to define an action `change` inside the controller `Article`. In both cases - the url address the same `/article/change/[id]/` where `[id]` is an article id.

But we have few special actions. First one is `index` that called when we provide nothing in url address after the controller name, for example request `/blogs` page. Second one is `not_found` that called when requested action doesn't found inside the requested controller.

Action function get only one argument - the [request](request.md) object. The `request` give you access to all data from request, including requested url address, request method, GET or POST data and more.
