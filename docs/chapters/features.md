- [x] **Fastest way to find requested page**. Load all controllers and their actions to dict to speedup lookup of desired url address.
- [x] **Dynamic url mapping**. You don't need to define url mapping in a separate place. Each url address has corresponding handler with the same name as requested in url. Now it's very easy to find the page handler in few seconds. Also it avoid problem with url overlap.

- [ ] **Middleware as expected**. When we need to do something before and after call the desired controller - we use middleware.
- [ ] **Templates in python style**. It will be good to create templates without closing tags in hierarchical structure, like we do in Python code or in YAML.
- [ ] **Auth out of the box**. Don't lose your time. Create new project and focus on project logic. You can login via external websites (facebook, twitter) in one click as well as via email.
