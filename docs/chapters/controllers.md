===

Controllers - business logic of your project. Controller contains multiple **actions** - methods of a the controller.

Project contains one or multiple controllers. All controllers located in `controllers` folder.

When you call a page `/blogs` the `controllers.blogs.Blogs` involved to handle this request. In this case - the `index` action will be called. When you call a page `/blogs/create` the same `Blogs` controller used, but will be called his `create` method.

Main project controller called `Index`. When you request website - you see welcome page that generated by `Index` controller and his `index` action. If you request page that doesn't exists - the `not_found` action calls, starting from requested controller and ending to search `not_found` action in the `Index` controller.
